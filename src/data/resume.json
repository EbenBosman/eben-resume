        "I am a self-taught, self-sufficient, motivated Full-Stack Web Developer. I strive to deliver the best quality, efficient and modern code possible.",
        "Attention to detail is my greatest professional concern, without it my work would just be average. I take great care in writing clean and readable, high quality code as the presentation of my work is the legacy which I leave.",
        "My favourite part of the work is dealing with the UX, although every other part is just as important. I prioritise visual perfection and user friendliness – with a simple test to judge if it is good enough: Would I like working with it as an end user?",
        "I feel at ease working in either a team environment or alone. Being a self-taught developer also means that I am at the stage in my career where I feel it necessary to \"pay it forward\" and help mentor junior developers.",
        "I have more than ten years experience in the software development industry and although I have no formal tertiary education, I believe that my practical experience has been an education of its own. This should stand me in good stead to complete any project successfully."
